Guidance for working in this repository.

## What this is

A personal [Umbrel Community App Store](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-apps).
Umbrel users add it by URL and install the apps it publishes.

- Store id: `mathieu` — display name: `Mathieu` (shown in umbrelOS as "Mathieu App Store")
- Defined in `umbrel-app-store.yml`
- This is a personal side project. It is **not** related to Primo (the owner's
  employer). Don't name things after Primo.

## Repository layout

```
umbrel-app-store.yml        # store id + name
<app-id>/
  umbrel-app.yml            # store listing metadata
  docker-compose.yml        # the app's services
```

Every app id **must** be prefixed with the store id `mathieu-`.
Example: `mathieu-healarr`. The folder name equals the app id.

Current apps:
- `mathieu-healarr` — Healarr (media library health monitoring)
- `mathieu-boxarr` — Boxarr (box office tracking, syncs with Radarr)
- `mathieu-tracearr` — Tracearr (Plex/Jellyfin/Emby monitoring; single-container "supervised" image with bundled TimescaleDB + Redis)

## Adding or updating an app

1. Create a folder `mathieu-<name>/` with `umbrel-app.yml` and `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Model the packaging on the official apps (https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-apps)
   and, for third-party images, on dennysubke/dennys-umbrel-app-store (a large,
   well-maintained community store with 200+ apps to copy conventions from).
3. Commit and push. Only commit/push when the user asks.

### docker-compose.yml conventions

- Always front the app with an `app_proxy` service:
  ```yaml
  services:
    app_proxy:
      environment:
        APP_HOST: mathieu-<name>_<service>_1   # <app-id>_<service-name>_1
        APP_PORT: <the app's internal port>
    <service>:
      image: <image>@sha256:<digest>           # pin by digest for reproducibility
      restart: on-failure
  ```
- Persist app data under `${APP_DATA_DIR}/data/...`.
  Umbrel owns this path as uid/gid **1000**.
- Shared Umbrel storage is at `${UMBREL_ROOT}/data/storage/...`
  (e.g. `downloads` is where the *arr apps place media). Mount read-only when
  the app only needs to read.
- For images that use linuxserver-style `PUID`/`PGID`, set both to `1000` so the
  container's user matches Umbrel's data ownership.
- **Do not add `cap_drop`, `security_opt: no-new-privileges`, or similar hardening
  flags** unless you have verified the image tolerates them. Many images start as
  root and drop privileges via `gosu`/`su-exec` + `chown`, which needs
  CAP_SETUID/CAP_SETGID/CAP_CHOWN. Dropping caps makes such entrypoints fail and
  the container exits — then `app_proxy` logs `The address '<id>_<svc>_1' cannot
  be found`. Umbrel provides isolation itself; these flags are not expected.

### umbrel-app.yml conventions

- `id` must equal the folder name and start with `mathieu-`.
- Pick a real `icon` URL and, ideally, `gallery` images. If the upstream repo has
  no screenshots, use `gallery: []` rather than linking broken images.
- Declare `permissions` the app needs (e.g. `STORAGE_DOWNLOADS`).

## Verifying an image tag before publishing (avoid "manifest unknown")

Docker image tags often differ from GitHub *release* tags (e.g. release
`v1.3.17` but image tag `1.3.17` with no `v`). Always confirm the exact tag and
grab its digest before committing:

```sh
REPO=mescon/healarr        # owner/name on ghcr.io
TAG=1.3.17
token=$(curl -s "https://ghcr.io/token?scope=repository:$REPO:pull" \
  | sed -E 's/.*"token":"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
# list tags
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  "https://ghcr.io/v2/$REPO/tags/list" | tr ',' '\n'
# confirm tag + get the digest to pin
curl -sI -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json" \
  "https://ghcr.io/v2/$REPO/manifests/$TAG" \
  | tr -d '\r' | awk -F': ' 'tolower($1)=="docker-content-digest"{print $2}'
```

A wrong tag surfaces on the Umbrel host as
`Error: (HTTP code 404) unexpected - manifest unknown` during install.

## Testing changes on Umbrel

The store polls for git updates periodically. To force a refresh immediately,
remove and re-add the community store in umbrelOS, then install the app. Useful
host-side debugging:

- `journalctl -u umbrel*` — install/repo-sync errors
- `docker logs mathieu-<name>_<service>_1` — the app container's own logs
- `app_proxy` "address cannot be found" == the service container crashed/exited
